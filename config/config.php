  | Here you should specify the name of the database to which your application
  | will connect. This name identifies the database on your server and is
  | necessary for the application to perform read and write operations.
  |
  | Make sure the name exactly matches the database name you have created on
  | your database server, as any discrepancy could prevent the application from
  | connecting properly.
  |
  | Example:
  | 'database_name' => 'openables',
  |
  */
    'database_name' => 'openables'
